# randomQuote
Random Quote generator website + python file


## The website
The html file uses the js script to pull a new quote from api which I found on github [https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable?tab=readme-ov-file#get-random-quote] and then displays it on the page. 


## Python
The python file prints the quote to the terminal using the same api. 


### Conclusion
this is a small project I used to understand how to work with api.
